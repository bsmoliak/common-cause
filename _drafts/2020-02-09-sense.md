> Did you hear that?

> The whip-poor-will,
>
> hidden in your heart,
>
> singing a song of warning.

> Did you smell that?
>
> The south wind,
>
> your exhalation,
>
> fueling stronger storms.
>
> Did you see that?
>
> Glimmer of light
>
> shining silently

>
> Did you taste that?
>
> _Mni_, life-giving water,
>
> moving through you now
>
> like a watershed.
>
> Did you touch that?
>
> _Manoomin_, wild rice,
>
> bowing in reverence
>
> as it grows on the water.
>
> And do you sense the new way
>
> inviting us again
>
> into the joyful murmur
>
> of partnership?
