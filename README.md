## A collaborative art project

Built with the [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) Starter Kit for Forestry. 
This is a very simple starting point if you wish to use Alembic
[as a Jekyll theme gem](https://alembic.darn.es/#as-a-jekyll-theme) with 
Forestry. If you'd like to do the same, use one of the deploy buttons below.
