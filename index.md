No person is alone, because they cannot be; they cannot arrange it so that either the good or the bad effects of their life will apply only to themself. Humans are whole not only insofar as they make common cause with each other, but also insofar as they make common cause with their native earth.

**-- paraphrased from Wendell Berry**
