> Did you hear that?  
> The whip-poor-will,  
> hidden in your heart,  
> singing a song of warning.

> Did you smell that?  
> The south wind,  
> your exhalation,  
> fueling stronger storms.

> Did you see that?  
> Glimmer of light  
> shining silently  
> on the horizon.

> Did you taste that?  
> _Mni_, life-giving water,  
> moving through you now  
> like a watershed.

> Did you touch that?  
> _Manoomin_, wild rice,  
> bowing in reverence  
> as it grows on the water.

> And do you sense the new way  
> inviting us again  
> into the joyful murmur  
> of partnership?
