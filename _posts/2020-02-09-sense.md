title: Do you sense it?

![A sunbeam from the setting sun passes through trees with no leaves in an autumn forest against the backdrop of a blue sky](https://commoncause.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/09599331-commoncause.jpg "Forest sunbeam")

Did you hear that?  
The whip-poor-will,  
hidden in your heart,  
singing a song of warning.

Did you smell that?  
The south wind,  
your exhalation,  
fueling stronger storms.

Did you see that?  
Glimmer of light  
shining silently  
on the horizon.

Did you taste that?  
_Mni_, life-giving water,  
moving through you now  
like a watershed.

Did you touch that?  
_Manoomin_, wild rice,  
bowing in reverence  
as it grows on the water.

And do you sense the new way  
inviting us again  
into the joyful murmur  
of partnership?
